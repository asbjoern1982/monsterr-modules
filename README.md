A couple of modules for the Monsterr framework.

# LatencyModule
A module for the admin client that shows the latency of each client on a graph

# NetworkModule
A module for the admin client that gives an overview over how the clients are connected.

# survey
An example stage for a survey.

To create your own survey, simply supply your own survey.json from https://surveyjs.io/Survey/Builder and edit /client/client.html and /client/thanks.html as needed.

If you want to be able to download the data via the admin client, there is an example of how to do that in admin-client.js (also look in the root server.js for the server-side events)

From the admin client it is possible to download the data as json or csv.
